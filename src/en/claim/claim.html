                        <b>SUCCESSFUL REAL ESTATE PROJECTS</b>
                        <p>
                            The job description of the project developer is only vaguely defined. For some, the project developer is a developer, builder or simply the initiator of a construction project. For the other, the project developer is synonymous with a project controller. More definitions circulate.
                            <br><br>
                            The project development of real estate as an independent profession is relatively new and much more complex than it may seem at first glance. Therefore, it is also worth considering the circumstances that have created the job of the project developer.
                            <br><br>
                            In the 19th century, demand for office space skyrocketed after a significant service industry emerged as a result of industrialization. Initially predominantly in New York and Chicago, in the second half of the 19th century, a completely new type of building appeared in European cities: the speculative office building, which had to be able to react flexibly to different demand scenarios.
                            <br><br>
                            Its triumphal procession was rapid, especially as the use of steel in building construction, new technologies in building air conditioning and not only safer, but also faster elevators allowed the construction of increasingly complex, ever higher buildings.
                            <br><br>
                            Due to the population explosion in the cities of the industrialized world, however, large-scale housing projects in a wide variety of formats have now emerged. Finally, in the middle of the 20th century - again in the USA - another new type of building was developed: the covered, air-conditioned shopping center.
                            <br><br>
                            Most of these projects were speculative in the face of anticipated positive demand. With large real estate projects could always earn a lot of money. However, always with the risk of high losses. The initiators quickly realized that the chances of success for a project can be significantly improved if, in terms of concept and architecture, it corresponds as closely as possible to the expectations of future users. In addition, it proved to be advantageous not only to set up a convincing marketing concept in order to find tenants and / or buyers for the property at an early stage, but also to minimize building costs and deadline risks by installing a professional project management.
                            <br/><br/>
                            The job of the project developer has emerged from these intense and hard-fought efforts to reduce the risk of loss of speculative construction and to increase the chances of profit through anticipatory action.
                            <br><br>
                            The modern project developer is able to positively influence and optimize all aspects of a construction project. It does not matter whether he works on his own account or as a service provider for investors who want to exploit the high return potential of real estate projects.
                            <br><br>
                            The project developer has to perform a multitude of management tasks and, in addition to his own specialist knowledge, has to have a broad and proven network of experts. Because without precise budgeting, solid financing, well thought-out contracts, coordinated and detailed planning, coordinated building rights, active management of construction work and professional letting and marketing, the successful implementation of a real estate project is not possible. Due to this extensive management services, the project developer is often considered the captain of a real estate project.
                            <br/><br/>
                            Undoubtedly, a lot of experience and expertise is needed to perfectly coordinate all aspects of a major construction project. Even more significant for the project's success, however, is the second area of ​​responsibility of the project developer:
                            <br><br>
                            The project developer determines the conception and the architectural language of his building projects. Thanks to his excellent knowledge of the market, he anticipates which criteria will be of importance to the future users of a building and derives therefrom precise requirements for building programs, design and quality standards. The project developer always influences the building planning results-oriented - from the overall concept to the smallest detail. In doing so, it also ensures the best possible coordination process between all planning participants and businesses. The result of such optimized building design is not only better quality, but also a significant cost savings, since unnecessary components are excluded from the outset.
                            <br><br>
                            Conclusion: Only the combination of qualified conceptual, creative work and professional project management makes it possible to realize every real estate project successfully.
                            <br><br>
                            Successful construction projects are also often pioneers for further investments in the same location. In this respect, the project developer can make a significant contribution to positive urban development. And with increasing environmental awareness of the public, the project developer will in the future also assume a great responsibility in the design of sustainable buildings.
