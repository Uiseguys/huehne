                        <b>Matthias C. Huhne</b>
                        <p>
                            Matthias C. Hühne, the founder, owner and CEO, graduated from Harvard University from 1985 to 1989 and completed his Bachelor of Arts.
                            <br><br>
                            After working for a project developer in Vancouver / Canada, for the real estate subsidiary of Deutsche Bank in Frankfurt am Main and as authorized officer and project manager for the American project developer Hines in Berlin, Matthias C. Hühne founded Hühne Development Services GmbH in the summer of 1996. 
                            <br><br>
                            To date, he has been responsible for projects worth more than 500,000 square meters. He has extensive experience in the design, planning, marketing, financing and project management of construction projects.
                            <br><br>
                            Matthias C. Hühne himself defined the specifications for their design, architecture and equipment qualities for several projects of Hühne Development Services GmbH. "I am firmly convinced," says Hühne, "that a first-class product always leads to success, as all of our previous projects have proven. First class in this sense does not necessarily mean luxurious, but rather perfectly adapted to the respective framework conditions. Based on good market knowledge and forward-looking planning, the risks of a real estate project can be mastered safely. "
                            <br><br>
                            Hühne once again demonstrated its manifold talents in 2014 with the founding of the art book publisher Callisto Publishers. The first book received international acclaim, including New York Times, Wall Street Journal, FAZ, Süddeutsche Zeitung, Monocle Magazine and leading design publications. 
                            <br><br>
                            In order to share his success and promote young talents, in 2013 he established the Hühne Foundation for Art and Architecture.
